# The_Terminal-
first c++ project

struggled with what direction to take the game;
added tasks;
the lists can be annoying;
lot of searching to see how to make a random number on interval;
made it so one can go back on eat/drink;
had to include the ampm function to not confuse player;
needed to know how much time was left;
learned about the do{}while() from Harvard CS 50x "do not trust the player";
mostly created by the small bit of lessons from codeacademy and previous knowledge from AP CSP;
